Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Bake salmon in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 14 minutes.

                        <p>
                            Start by marinading organic, grass fed flank steak cut into bite size pieces with coconut aminos, sesame oil, sambal, garlic, fresh grated ginger, and honey. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour. Heat sesame oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Make sure the pan is super hot then add your steak and veggies of choice- I did shredded carrots. The steak should cook with about 3 minutes on each side. Remove from heat and stir in fresh basil. Serve with your choice of rice!
